	; http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/pdp-11/hints.html
	; Any DL-11 style serial port (including the console) can be simply
	; tested by depositing 060 (octal) into its 'transmitter buffer ',
	; 0777566 in the case of the console. A '0' should appear on the
	; console. If it is anything else, check the baud rate settings.
	;
	; To check the input register, press the '0', then examine the
	; receive register 0777562 and it should contain 060.
	;
	; Needles to say, if you are using any of the Qbus processors,
	; or a PDP11/24, /44, /84 or /94 then you need the serial console
	; working to do anything.
	;
	; As simple serial echo test would be:-

	.asect

	kbs = 177560 $


	.=165000
	.word 0165004
	.word 0200
start:
	mov #kbs, r0

wait:	tstb (r0)	; character received?
	bpl wait	; no, loop
	mov 2(r0),6(r0) ; transmit data

	br wait 	; get next character

	; Note:- PDP11 guru's will notice that I don't test for
	; transmitter ready, as there is little point given that you
	; cannot type fast enough for it to overrun!
