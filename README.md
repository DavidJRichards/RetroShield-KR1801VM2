# RetroShield-KR1801VM2RetroShield inspired project for the Soviet KR1081VM2 PDP-11 compatible processorThis is a work-in-progress project inspired by Erturk Kocalar's RetroShield project (https://gitlab.com/8bitforce).RetroShield 1801VM2 is a hardware shield for Arduino Mega.* It enables Arduino to emulate peripherals and run PDP-11 programs on a Soviet PDP-11 compatible processor.* You can try PDP-11 assembly and run some of the old PDP-11 programs without building complicated circuits.* You can use existing Arduino shields to extend the capabilities.* The Arduino Mega sketch is inspired by my PDP-11/04 and includes the following DEC peripherals:     M7856 DL-11W SLU as a Console        M7856 DL-11W SLU as a TU58 Interface (not yet proven to actually boot anything)        M9312 Terminator/ROM board to host ROMs from https://www.ak6dn.com/PDP-11/M9312/     * Schematic and the Arduino Sketch is provided for you to study and play.Revision 1 RetroShield for KR1801VM2  ![RetroShield Rev 1 for KR1801VM2](Docs/KR1801VM2_rev1_1.jpg)![RetroShield Rev 1 for KR1801VM2](Docs/KR1801VM2_rev1_2.jpg)Prototype RetroShield for KR1801VM2  ![Prototype RetroShield for KR1801VM2](Docs/KR1801VM2_prototype.jpg)Forked 15/02/2020 to make changes for Teensy 3.5, added Teensy and Data folders
